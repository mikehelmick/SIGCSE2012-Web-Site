<p>The Association for Computing Machinery (<a href="http://www.acm.org">ACM</a>) Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (<a href="http://www.sigcse.org">SIGCSE</a>) is a community of approximately 2,600 educators and students possessing a passion for studying and improving the state of computer science education at all levels. The annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium is the flagship conference of our organization, and is attended by approximately 1,300 people.  Conference attendees travel from across the globe to learn new educational techniques, to examine the latest textbooks, to share ideas with colleagues, to talk with computing professionals, and to acquire hands-on experience with new hardware and software, including software development environments, classroom presentation technologies, on-line collaboration tools, and robotics.</p>
