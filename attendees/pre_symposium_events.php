<p>The Teaching Open Source Symposium is a gathering spot for those interested in student participation in open, informal communities as a way to further the learning of computing. While 
most of us do this by assigning classwork that involves students in open source software projects such as Mozilla Firefox, various Linux distributions, or humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS), we also cover open hardware and content projects (as in Wikipedia), hackerspaces, language and other technical meetup groups, and communication processes that promote realtime transparency such as the use of wikis and blogging. This event unites newcomers with members from the Teaching Open Source community (<a href="http://teachingopensource.org">http://teachingopensource.org</a>), an emergent (3 year old) group working on scaffolding to bridge the cultural differences between academic and FOSS communities of practice. Join us to share questions, challenges, and triumphs of incorporating FOSS participation into existing and new curricula as well support resources for doing so. Alumni and current members of the POSSE (<a href="http://communityleadershipteam.org/posse">Professors' Open Source Summer Experience</a>) will attend in mentorship roles, as we discuss topics in an unconference-style environment, a format specifically designed to invoke participation, teaching, and learning by all attendees regardless of prior topic experience.

<h2><a name="career">Career Mentoring Workshop</a></h2>
</div></div>

<p>The goal of the Career Mentoring Workshop is to provide critical mentoring information for instructors, pre-tenure faculty and graduate students in Computer Science and Engineering who are interested in an academic career.  The day-long workshop, to be held on Wednesday, February 29, will be co-located with the SIGCSE 2012 conference in Raleigh.</p>
<p>Tentative topics will include:  Mentoring, Teaching Strategies, Getting Started with Research / Finding Funding / Research with Undergraduates, Promotion and Tenure, Time Management, and Balancing Priorities (i.e., teaching vs. research vs. service).</p>
<p><strong>Workshop participants must commit to attending the complete workshop on February 29 from 8am-5pm and are encouraged to attend all of the SIGCSE 2012 conference.</strong></p>
<p>For more information about the workshop, contact Susan Rodger (<script>write_email( "rodger", "cs.duke.edu" );</script>) or Sheila Castaneda (<script>write_email("sheila.castaneda", "clarke.edu");</script>) or Dave Reed (<script>write_email("DaveReed", "creighton.edu");</script>).</p>
<p><strong>The workshop is by invitation only after completing and submitting <a href="/sigcse2012/attendees/downloads/mentoringapplication.pdf">this application<a/>.</strong></p>

<p>This is an open meeting of ACM's Special Interest Group on Computers and Society (SIGCAS).  SIGCAS’ work on the ACM CS2013 Curriculum Committee to develop updated guidelines for the Social and Professional (SP) knowledge area of Computer Science will be discussed, along with other issues of interest to the SIGCSE/SIGCAS community. This will also be an opportunity for SIGCAS members and supporters to provide input into the future direction of the SIG.  Particular attention will be paid to issues of interest to SIGCAS members who are primarily computer science educators.</p>

<p>In support of ACM's Commitment to Ethical Professionalism this event is designed to help faculty provide students with tools to better understand and resolve the ethical challenges. It will specifically address the needs of those who are teaching or about to teach Computer ethics.  It will emphasize active learning with small group activities engaging the participants in interactive exercises to introduce and enhance their computer ethics teaching skills; there will be exercises in developing course syllabi, designing and evaluating class materials, ethical scenarios. We will also make available to the participants material which can be used to engage students in the study of applied ethics.

<p>CSAB, Inc., the lead ABET society for accreditation of degree programs in computer science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering, is offering this workshop for computing faculty and administrators interested in seeking accreditation or reaccreditation. Attendees will participate in a full day of hands-on accreditation training covering both general and program criteria with a special emphasis on the assessment process. The workshop will be led by experienced ABET team chairs, and the cost includes meals and materials.</p>

<p>This workshop is intended for teachers who have little or no experience in teaching with Alice. The workshop will provide hands-on experience with learning to use Alice 2.2 and in learning to teach with Alice. Alice 2.2 is a powerful program visualization environment where students are engaged in building virtual worlds to create animations and simple games. Instructional materials, software, and a complimentary copy of the 3rd edition of the text, Learning to Program with Alice, will be provided to each participant.  Bring your own laptop (PC or Mac) and a mouse. Alice 2.2 does not work well on most netbooks.</p>

<p>This workshop is designed for instructors of CS1/AP who are interested in providing a gentle introduction to programming concepts in Alice 3 integral with mediating the transfer of these concepts into Java. The workshop will introduce Alice 3 and a plugin for transitioning from Alice to Java. Alice 3 builds on Alice 2's powerful program visualization technique, enabling students to "see" objects and work with object-oriented programming. Participants will learn how to use Alice 3 to build virtual worlds and how to use this approach in CS1 courses (introductory programming for majors and non-majors and AP CS). Bring your own laptop (PC or Mac) and a mouse. . Alice 2.2 does not work well on most netbooks.</p>
