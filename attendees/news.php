<p><strong>Impact for the First Lady’s visit will begin Thursday evening and should be done by mid-afternoon Friday.</strong></p>

<p>TO GET TO THE CONVENTION CENTER FROM THE MARRIOTT OR SHERATON, WALK TO CABARRUS STREET AND USE THE CABARRUS STREET ENTRANCE OF THE RCC.  THE MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE TO THE RCC, AS WELL AS THE UNDERGROUND CONNECTOR FROM THE MARRIOTT, WILL BE CLOSED ON FRIDAY.</p>

<p><strong>ENTRANCES closed on Friday include:</strong><ul>
 <li>The Salisbury Street entrance to the convention center (SIGCSE attendees 
should enter from Cabarrus Street).</li>

</ul></p>
<p><strong>PARKING under the Marriott will be closed after a security sweep on Thursday.</strong><ul>
 <li>Officially the parking closure begins THURSDAY evening.</li>
 <li>This affects the main parking garage entrance that is located at the corner of Lenoir and Fayetteville.  Alternate entrance to the available portion of the deck is from Wilmington Street.
