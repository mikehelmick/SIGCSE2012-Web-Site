 <li>Double-check the information about your submission that is recorded in the SIGCSE 2012 database.

 <p style="font-size: 1.0em">To check and/or update your Title and Author(s) listing in the SIGCSE database, use your submission ID number and password assigned to your submission by accessing the <a href="http://db.grinnell.edu/sigcse/sigcse2012/Submissions/submissionRegular.asp">Form for Submitting Materials and Updating Proposer Information</a> and proceed to the section entitled <strong>Verify/Update Previously-Submitted Materials</strong>.</p>

                   <strong>SIGCSE Guidelines</strong> -
                   Double-check that your submission adheres to the
                   <a href="/sigcse2012/authors/format.php">SIGCSE 2012 Format Instructions</a>
                   and includes all required sections (i.e., Abstract,
                   Categories &amp; Subject Descriptors, General Terms,
                   and Keywords).  These are the same guidelines published
                   when you submitted your paper/panel/special session,
                   so hopefully you should not have to make any significant
                   modifications.  We encourage authors to use the
                   <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html">templates available on ACM's website</a>.
                   LaTeX users should use 
                   <a href="http://sheridanprinting.com/typedept/sig-alternate.cls">sig-alternate.cls</a>

                   </p>

<p><b>New ACM Reference guidelines.</b>
<br/>Elements (in most cases):

<ol>
<li>Author(s)</li>
<li>Year of publication</li>
<li>Title of 'document' - use initial caps on keywords and end in period.</li>
<li>Name of Site in italics if given, and followed by period.</li>
<li>Date accessed - Use 'Retrieved' followed by date as Month, DD, YYYY followed by 'from'</li>
<li>Address - Given as '{http|ftp|telnet}://path' and underlined.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Note: a web address should never be given for a formally published document whose citation is complete or for which there is a DOI. Only give a web address for informal works or online-only works or resources that cannot otherwise be found by citation and/or DOI. Author Home page URLs or Institutional Repository URLs are not the way to cite formally published literature. If citing a formally published online-only publication, use the format for that genre and add elements 5 and 6 above.</p>
