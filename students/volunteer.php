<h1>Student Volunteers @ SIGCSE 2012</h1>
</div></div>
<p>Student volunteers are an important part of the SIGCSE Symposium and have been for many years.  Each volunteer works for up to 6 hours, helping with various conference management activities.  You'll interact with the conference organizers and presenters and will meet other students from all over the world.  More information about the experience, the benefits, and how to sign up are provided below.</p>
<!-- <p>Student Volunteer registration is now closed.  You may still attend the conference; register to attend on the SIGCSE 2012 registration page).  Any questions should be directed to Briana Morrison at <script>write_email( "sigcse11-volunteers", "cs.cmu.edu" );</script></p> -->

<p>Any full time student may become a student volunteer. Both undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. You specify your school affiliation when you sign up as a volunteer, and you should bring a copy of your current course schedule to the conference as verification of your full time status.  Students attending the conference for the Research Poster competition are encouraged to become volunteers as well.</p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>What kinds of work will I do as a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
<p>
It varies. You might work at the registration booth to help organize the packets that we give out to attendees. You might be at the door of the exhibits hall to verify that the people entering have a conference badge. You might count the participants at various sessions. You might hang out at certain sessions to assist the speakers with handouts or equipment.</p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Do I have a say in what work I do as a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
<p> Not much, but we'll do what we can.  There are often fewer volunteers than we have jobs, so we have to prioritize.</p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>When during the conference will I do my student volunteer work?</h2>
</div></div> 
<p>This issue is driven by conference needs. Some time periods are busier than others. We'll take your preferences into account whenever possible. When you sign up as a student volunteer, you'll specify when you plan to arrive and leave the conference. You will also have the opportunity to specify when you are presenting a paper or poster. Within those constraints, we'll make some initial plans. We realize that things may come up and will try to make dynamic changes as needed. In return, we ask that you be as flexible as possible. Your duties may be broken into separate time periods and even across separate days.  We guarantee no more than 6 hours of assigned work per volunteer but target an average of 5 hours.</p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Do I have to be there for the whole conference to be a student volunteer?</h2>
</div></div> 
<p>No. We realize that travel plans and other commitments exist. We hope that students local to the Raleigh area will be flexible.  In particular, there is always a need for volunteers on Tuesday and Wednesday, which is before most of the conference activities begin and before many of the traveling student volunteers have arrived. We encourage local student volunteers to be available on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<div class="SectionHeader"><div class="Full">
<h2>Can I get funding for travel or hotel expenses?</h2>
</div></div> 
<p>The conference itself does not provide funding for student volunteers, but you may be able to get some support through your department or through another source at your university.  You should print your registration acknowledgment to show to potential funding sources.</p>
